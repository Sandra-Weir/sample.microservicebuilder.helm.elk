# ELK Sample Docs

Overview
--
The ELK Sample is a sample configuration of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, used to monitor logging and tracing metrics, generated by the Liberty server.

More information on the ELK Sample project is available on the [About the ELK Sample](sample_elk_concept.md) page.

Once you're ready to deploy the ELK Sample, visit the [Installing the ELK Sample](installing_sample_elk_task.md) page. To configure the ELK stack, see [Using the ELK Sample](sample_elk_task.md).

Useful tips for [Troubleshooting](sample_elk_troubleshoot.md) are also available.

This sample works on x86_64 architectures only at this moment.
